## 📊 Tools & Technologies

- **Python**  
- **Pandas & NumPy** – Data cleaning and manipulation  
- **Scikit-learn** – Logistic regression modeling  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization  

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Preprocess and encode HR dataset features  
- Train a logistic regression model to predict employee attrition  
- Evaluate the model with classification metrics and a confusion matrix  
- Provide insights to help HR teams proactively manage retention strategies

---

## 📈 Key Findings
  

- Logistic regression showed strong accuracy in predicting employee retention, but had limited recall for identifying employees likely to leave.
- This highlights the need for balanced modeling approaches to better support HR strategy and retention planning.
- The model can inform HR strategy with minimal complexity
